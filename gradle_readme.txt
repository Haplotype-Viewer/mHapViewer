The IGV JAR build now uses Gradle instead of Ant.  

Install Gradle for your platform.  See https://gradle.org/ for details.  At this time, *only* Java 8
is supported; we're working on support for Java 9+ in a future update.

Builds are executed from the IGV project directory.  Files will be created in the 'build' subdirectory.
You may need to execute 'gradle wrapper' to set up the gradle wrapper.  This should be necessary the 
first time only, or if you clean up the local .gradle directory.  Only do this if the './gradlew' calls
fail.

There are two different build options, one for Java 8 and another for Java 9 and up.  The default is 
to build for Java 8.  Java 8 builds are *NOT* compatible with Java 9 and vice versa.  

There are other options but these cover the most common uses:
- Use './gradlew createDist' to build a "distribution" directory (found in 'build/dist') containing 
  igv.jar, all of the third-party library JARs as well as helper scripts for launching.  
  Launch with 'igv.sh' on UNIX, 'igv.command' on Mac, and 'igv.bat' on Windows.  These scripts can be
  edited to adjust e.g. JVM flags like maximum memory, etc.
  Note that Gradle creates a number of other subdirectories in 'build'.  These can be safely ignored.
- Use './gradlew build' to build everything and run the test suite.  See 'src/test/README.txt' for more
  information about running the tests.
- OPTIONAL: assuming Ant is installed and configured with BCEL, a reduced-footprint version of the JAR
  can be produced by running './gradlew jar' or './gradlew build' and then 'ant -f build-shrink.xml'.  
  This JAR will be found in 'build/IGV-dist' along with two supporting JARs (batik-codec and goby) and
  helper scripts to run them (as above).
  All three JARs must be in the same location in order to run IGV. 
  These three JARs will be identical to those available in the download bundles from our website, with 
  the exception that they will not be signed with our certificate (required for JNLP).  

The instructions for Java 9 are nearly identical other than the need to specify the Java 9 build file
and that the results will be found in 'build_java9' rather than 'build'.  More specifically:
- Use './gradlew -b build_java9.gradle createDist' to build a distribution directory with helper scripts
  for launching.  The structure is slightly different but the concept is the same.
- Use './gradlew -b build_java9.gradle build' to build everything and run the test suite.

The reduced-footprint JAR build option is *NOT* available for Java 9+ at this time.  We will explore 
alternatives in the future. 

NOTE: In the above, use './gradlew.bat' on the Windows platform.
